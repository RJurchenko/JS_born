## What is source code?  
Source code is the fundamental component of a computer program that is created by a programmer. It can be read and easily understood by a human being. You can view it in Chrome by clicking the right mouse buttot and click on "View page source", or "CTRL+U".  
## What are tags?  
  
## How are symbols stored?  
Symbols are stored in bits & bytes. The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit.[1] The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, +/−, or on/off are also commonly used. The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of **eight bits**.  
**ASCII** abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.  
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the name US-ASCII for this character encoding
